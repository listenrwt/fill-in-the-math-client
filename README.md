## How to play?

1. Objective
The objective of the game is to be the last man standing. Upon completing arithmetic puzzles, you can heal yourself
by extending your timer, or attacking other players by diminishing theirs.

2. Your first game
Upon being greeted by the lobby, you can choose to either "Quick Join", "Host Game", or "Join Game". The first option
is the quickest way to hop into a random game, the second and third option is for playing with friends, where you can
either host a game for you or your friends or join a game your friend is hosting via entering the room code.

Good Luck, Have Fun!
